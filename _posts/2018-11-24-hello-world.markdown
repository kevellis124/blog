Well, hello there everyone!

This is my first blog I've ever written. I have, however, _read_ many blogs. I'm not sure how much that entitles me to
claim expertise on blogs in general, but I certainly feel like I can finally write one.

The many blogs I've read over the years have shown me the medium is an excellent one to share knowledge. I've learned countless
techniques for software development from blogs, and have had many ideas sparked by others' found on blogs like this one.

My hope with this is to continue the knowledge sharing, further my own professional growth, and communication skills. My goal is to
create posts that are both educational and informative, mostly regarding technical topics i've learned or am learning about.

I hope to submit my first real post soon about hosting a single-page application using github pages.

Looking forward to this, thanks to all who want to be a part of it!
